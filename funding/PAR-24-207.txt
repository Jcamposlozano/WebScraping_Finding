<p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Background</strong> </p><p style="margin-left:0in;">Liver diseases and liver cancer contribute to a significant health burden in the U.S. These conditions include chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C (HCV) viral infections, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; currently known as metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD]), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; currently known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis [MASH]), chronic liver disease (CLD; currently known as steatotic liver disease [SLD]), and liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Prevalence, severity and mortality of CLD and liver cancer are higher among all racial and ethnic minority populations, people with lower socioeconomic status (SES), and sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. For example, HBV and HCV infection, which often serve as precursors and risk factors to liver diseases and liver cancer, are more prevalent among certain populations. Non–US-born people account for 69% of prevalent chronic HBV infections in the U.S. Chronic HBV prevalence is 14x higher among Asian Americans and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander persons than among White persons, although acute HBV is highest among Black persons, with a 1.5x higher prevalence than in White persons. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons are over twice as likely as White persons to develop chronic HCV. Hispanics/Latinos have a 1.4x higher risk than White persons of developing NAFLD or NASH. Disparities also exist in alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and alcohol-related cirrhosis prevalence. Compared to White persons, all racial and ethnic minority populations have a higher burden of liver cancer, with AI/AN populations reporting an almost three-fold higher burden of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) also disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority populations. Preventable chronic liver diseases contribute to cirrhosis and HCC-related mortality. Poverty and low SES have also been linked to a 1.5 times increased risk of HCC incidence and over double the increased risk of CLD mortality, as well as other adverse liver disease and/or liver cancer outcomes. Based on limited data, SGM populations are disproportionately affected by HBV, HCV, and potentially NAFLD, as well as traditional risk factors for CLD, ALD, and liver cancer.</p><p>Research on the causes of these health disparities has been emerging in recent years. The common risk factors (e.g., toxin exposure, substance use, exposure to HBV/HCV infection) for CLD and liver cancer are well-established and are more frequently reported among populations experiencing disparities. These populations are more susceptible to risk factors that are shaped by multi-level, multi-domain influences (e.g., discrimination, economic status, immigration status, education, public safety, language, cultural barriers). Collectively known as social determinants of health (SDOH), these are multi-level social factors with an impact on human health that help to explain population-based differences in healthcare (i.e., screening, surveillance, and treatment) access, utilization, and literacy underlying liver disease and liver cancer health disparities. Co-infection with HIV, chronic disease comorbidity, food insecurity, and exposure to environmental pollutants are linked to adverse liver disease outcomes in populations experiencing liver disease and liver cancer disparities. The SDOH exposures and liver disease and liver cancer outcomes also differ based on intersectionality of belonging to multiple populations experiencing disparities. For example, Latinos of Mexican descent living in Southeast Texas experience a combination of risk factors that contribute to this population’s exceedingly high rates of liver disease and/or liver cancer. Individuals from populations experiencing health disparities are also more likely to be unaware of their elevated risk for CLD and liver cancer and may be living with undiagnosed, preventable, and curable conditions. To reduce CLD and liver cancer among populations experiencing health disparities, interventions addressing the interplay of systemic, environmental, behavioral, and biological pathways of liver disease and/or cancer susceptibility and progression are needed. </p><p>Currently, the evidence on  effective liver disease or liver cancer interventions among populations with health disparities is limited. Although medical advances have made an HBV vaccine and treatment for HCV that cures 95% of cases over a 12-week treatment course available, however these interventions have been not implemented among populations with health disparities effectively. Community-based and/or policy-level interventions targeting SDOH and providing patients with access to streamlined comprehensive care have reduced or eliminated race and ethnicity-based disparities in treatment initiation and completion. For example, interventions among Asian American populations have successfully reduced population-level HBV and liver cancer incidence (rate per 100,000) in this population from 16 in 2007 to 10 in 2020. However, interventions rarely address or measure the influence of social and institutional systems and structures that influence health outcomes, such as laws, policies, and social norms, on disparate disease progression and clinical outcomes. Tailored interventions are needed to address worsening disparities in liver disease and liver cancer. </p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p><p>The objective of this initiative is to develop and test multidisciplinary and multi-level and/or multi-domain interventions that will effectively address liver disease and liver cancer disparities. These disparities reflect disproportionate disease burden and worse outcomes among populations experiencing health disparities. NIMHD-designated populations with health disparities<i><strong> </strong></i>include racial and ethnic minority populations, people with lower socioeconomic status (SES) status, and their intersectionality with living in underserved rural communities, SGM populations and/or people with disabilities (see <a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/funding/nimhd-funding/funding-strategy.html">https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/funding/nimhd-funding/funding-strategy.html</a>).</p><p>The focus of this initiative is on improving screening, prevention, treatment, management, and survivorship of liver diseases and liver cancer among populations experiencing disparities. Interventions that target the complex causes or consequences of health disparities and address, identify, and promote protective factors of liver disease and/or liver cancer are encouraged. Interventions that extend beyond modifying individual-level health behavior are needed (i.e., interpersonal, community, societal). The proposed projects are encouraged to measure the multi-level and/or multi-domain SDOH addressed and affected by the intervention. The intervention research under this NOFO should be aimed at improving outcomes directly related to liver disease and/or liver health among populations experiencing disparities. NIMHD has a specific interest in projects that examine the impact of determinants at multiple domains (biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) acting at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) of socio-ecological influence (see the NIMHD Research Framework, <a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html">https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html</a>).</p><p>To advance health equity in this area, applicants are encouraged to conduct tailored interventions in a variety of settings (i.e., clinics, schools, community centers, pharmacies, workplaces, churches, justice settings, fitness centers), disaggregated subpopulations, and include unique considerations of persons belonging to multiple populations experiencing health disparities through an intersectional approach whenever possible. Projects should include U.S. studies of populations experiencing health disparities and are encouraged to include disaggregated subpopulations and consideration of immigration status, generation, and country of origin or heritage. Studies of SGM populations are expected to include unique relevant clinical factors. . Environmental measurements, including personal and intergenerational histories (e.g., geographic region, birthplace), are also encouraged to further elucidate contextual influences of liver disease and/or liver cancer among populations with disparities. Proposed interventions are encouraged to focus beyond increasing awareness and screening alone to include changes in modifiable factors of liver disease and/or liver cancer incidence and progression. Intervention projects addressing co-infections such as with HIV and chronic disease comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, SUD) are of interest.<i> </i>Multidisciplinary expertise and approaches appropriate to understand and overcome the challenges of developing and conducting multidimensional interventions to address disparities in liver disease and/or liver cancer are strongly encouraged.   </p><p>Investigators proposing to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical, behavioral, or clinical outcome are strongly encouraged to use appropriate intervention study designs, such as a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, a stepped-wedge group- or cluster randomized trial, a rigorous quasi-experimental design such as a group- or cluster-level regression discontinuity design or an interrupted time-series design, or a rigorous alternative. Whenever participants are assigned to study arms in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities, counties, states) and observations taken on individual participants are analyzed for intervention effects, special methods are required for analysis and sample size. Methods consistent with plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions should be documented in the application (additional information available at <a href="https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/"><i>https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/</i></a>). Applicants are strongly encouraged to assess SDOH using measures available in the Social Determinants of Health Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (<a href="http://www.phenxtoolkit.org/" title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">www.phenxtoolkit.org</a>), as appropriate. Interventions may also include health information technology applications (e.g., behavior monitoring tools, decision aids, health information portals, and others) and/or social media elements to improve disparities and improve health. “Natural experiments,” or the evaluation of an exposure or change not directly manipulated by the researcher, where liver disease and/or liver cancer-related health disparities can be assessed based on this variation in exposures, are also of interest. There is also a particular interest in interventions addressing liver disease and its risk factors at its earliest stages before progression to more chronic conditions occurs.</p><p>Projects should be community-engaged and culturally grounded. For this NOFO, we encourage approaches that include greater participation and collaboration with the community of interest, including shared leadership of community members in the research design and implementation of the project. Collaborations with relevant community and organizational entities may include researchers with relevant lived experience, community organizations, healthcare providers, public health organizations, consumer advocacy groups, and places of worship or religious institutions. Specifically, projects are expected to recognize the diversity of disproportionately affected populations and value of lived experiences to address the unique needs of a target community with cultural sensitivity and awareness of what may limit or facilitate the availability of resources. As appropriate for the research questions posed, inclusion of key community members in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of the research is encouraged. Research applications are also encouraged to propose culturally and environmentally appropriate<strong> </strong>interventions to generate better-informed hypotheses, improve adaptation based on real-world context and environment challenges, and enhance the translation of the research results into further implementation.</p><p><strong>Specific Areas of Research Interest</strong></p><p>Research topics of interest among population experiencing health disparities include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Multi-level and/or multi-domain interventions developed to improve HBV and HCV screening uptake methods and approaches, including appropriate screening recommendations and linkage to prevention and care methods for persons belonging to multiple populations experiencing health disparities</li><li> Interventions that employ multi-level (Patient, Caregiver, Provider, System) culturally and linguistically diverse communication strategies to address multiple synergistic risk and protective environmental and behavioral factors to improve liver health, with at least alcohol, smoking, other substance use, and chemical exposures listed among the contributing factors</li><li>Intervention strategies promoting HBV vaccination acceptance and linkage to care, reducing barriers to uptake, and improving successful series completion</li><li>Interventions improving HBV and HCV health care navigation services, treatment access, disease management resources, linkage to timely care, adherence, and completion for persons with chronic infection</li><li>Develop and conduct interventions promoting HCV treatment uptake, adherence, and completion among partially and untreated persons to reduce disparities and improve curability</li><li>Interventions that are community engaged and incorporate non-invasive and accessible NAFLD, NASH, and/or CLD screening strategies to improve and facilitate risk detection and/or accelerated disease progression at earlier stages of liver disease and/or liver cancer</li><li>Culturally appropriate, risk reduction and/or health promotion interventions addressing co-infections and or co-morbidities in underserved geographical areas or among immigrant persons, including adaptations of existing evidence-based intervention strategies addressing liver diseases and/or liver cancer disparities.</li><li>Projects incorporating inter-generational and interpersonal factors through interventions addressing maternal-to-child transmission and/or family-level influences on liver disease and/or cancer liver cancer risk</li><li>Interventions addressing the early-onset of well-established risk factors for liver disease and/or liver cancer (e.g., toxin exposure, substance use, exposure to HBV/HCV infection)</li><li>Developing and testing interventions promoting resiliency, well-being, and/or protective factors, such as indigenous and cultural practices and resources adapted to specific populations and settings, that influence liver disease and/or cancer incidence and progression</li><li>Interventions that incorporate structural and/or institutional discrimination that in addressing liver disease and/or liver cancer incidence and progression</li><li>Interventions addressing CLD and/or liver cancer to improve disease prevention, self-management, and health care delivery across the continuum of care</li><li>Develop and conduct interventions tailored to address unique considerations of the diagnostic and management pathway for persons with liver cancer (HCC) belonging to one or more populations experiencing health disparities</li><li>Interventions to improve the access and quality of survivorship care and recommendations in liver cancer survivors</li><li>Develop and conduct interventions addressing screening, disease management, and treatment of HBV, HCV, other liver diseases, and/or liver cancer in persons with or at risk of substance use disorders</li><li>Policy-level interventions or natural experiments that address liver disease and/or liver cancer-related determinants of health and their impact on disparities</li></ul><p>Participating NIH ICs have identified priority research areas below. Applicants are encouraged to speak with IC representatives for technical assistance (see Agency Contacts in Section VII).<u> Applicants should ensure that the IC they wish to target participates in the NOFO to which they wish to submit. </u></p><p><strong>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</strong></p><p>The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) public health framework for ending cancer includes addressing modifiable determinants of health and eliminating persistent injustices through research at the individual, social, institutional, structural, environmental, and policy levels. NCI is deeply committed to a better understanding and development of evidence-based interventions that could address the health disparities witnessed in liver cancer.</p><p>For this NOFO, NCI areas of interest in intervention research include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Intervention research focusing on environmental exposures, particularly exposures experienced by residents of environmental justice communities that are at greater risk for liver cancer and exposures occurring more frequently in populations experiencing liver cancer disparities. </li><li>Research on interventions intended to reduce health disparities in liver cancer that occur beyond HBV/HCV. We emphasize these areas because research gaps particularly exist for interventions that focus on non-viral factors in high-risk populations.</li><li>Intervention research that will address multi-level and/or multi-domain social determinants of health (e.g., neighborhood and built environment, and social and community contexts) related to liver cancer disparities.</li><li>Intervention research that promotes cancer control leading to equitable outcomes in liver cancer.  These studies may include research that spans topics of screening, prevention, treatment, management, and/or survivorship aspects of liver cancer in populations experiencing disparities and may focus on protective and/or upstream factors of liver cancer. </li></ul>

<p class="Normal">HHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.</p>
<p class="Normal">In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to System for Award Management (SAM.gov) requirements. SAM.gov requires Federal agencies to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently SAM.gov) prior to making an award. An applicant can review and comment on any information in the responsibility/qualification records available in SAM.gov. NIH will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the information available in the responsibility/qualification records in SAM.gov, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.</p>

<p class="Normal">In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 2 CFR Part 200.113 and Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period.  The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (Responsibility/Qualification in SAM.gov, formerly FAPIIS).  This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313).  As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.  Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200 – Award Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.</p>
