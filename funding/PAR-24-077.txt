<p style="margin-left:15.7pt;"><strong>Background</strong></p><p style="margin-left:15.85pt;">Although scientific and technological discoveries have improved the health of the U.S. population overall, populations affected by health disparities such as sexual and gender minorities (SGM) from racial and ethnic minoritized populations and from less privileged socioeconomic statuses (SES) continue to experience a disproportionate burden of disease and risk factors, and unmet healthcare needs.</p><p style="margin-left:15.85pt;">SGM populations experience a wide range of health disparities. Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian and bisexual women have higher odds of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) thought to be related in part to higher levels of mental distress, higher rates of current smoking, and greater obesity. Breast cancer may also be more common among SGM women in part related to higher rates of obesity and lower rates of pregnancy. Transgender adults are more likely to have elevated rates of myocardial infarction and CVD risk factors than their cisgender counterparts. SGM populations are also disproportionately affected by disparities in mental health conditions, as LGBTQ individuals experience increased anxiety, depression, and suicidality than people who identify as heterosexual and cisgender. People who identify as LGBTQ+ also experience greater substance use and behavioral health disparities than heterosexual cisgender individuals, including greater use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. SGM populations also experience greater disparities in sleep disturbances compared to non-sexual minority persons.</p><p style="margin-left:15.85pt;">Disparities are likely to be worse for members of SGM populations who possess two or more intersecting, marginalized social statuses especially racial/ethnic minority groups and those with lower SES. For example, people identifying as LGBTQ+ and intersex individuals are at high risk of violence from family members, peers, partners, and strangers, with bisexual and transgender individuals particularly transgender women of color experiencing the highest risk for violence. Further, about 40% of transgender women surveyed in seven major U.S. cities from 2019 to 2020 reported a positive HIV status, with Black/African American and Latina transgender women disproportionately represented. Cisgender gay and bisexual men accounted for 69% of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. in 2019, with Black/African American and Latino/Hispanic gay and bisexual men accounting for 70% of new infections and of persons living with HIV.</p><p style="margin-left:15.85pt;">While the extent of health disparities experienced by SGM populations is largely documented in the literature, research gaps exist in the identification and characterization of pathways and mechanisms through which disparities develop and persist. Moreover, a need exists to evaluate interventions to address disparities, especially for SGM individuals from racial and ethnic minoritized populations who report lower SES as they are under investigated. Scant are longitudinal studies on the development and evolution of structural stigma over the life course and its impact on health and healthcare disparities among SGM populations, and the consideration of intersectional characteristics. Moreover, there are research gaps concerning the origins, pathways, and health consequences of minority stress and factors that support resilience. Key research gaps also include the paucity of evidence-based interventions in SGM research, including interventions that address health disparities among racially and ethnically minoritized SGM populations. Lastly, research must test interventions to improve access to and quality of care such as promoting culturally responsive and clinically appropriate care.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Studies must examine health or healthcare outcome(s) among SGM populations. Studies among SGM populations who are also from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds (Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander populations) and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations will be the main focus of the NIMHD area of interest in this funding opportunity. Individual-level studies focusing on understudied groups among SGM populations, including SGM people of color, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender, Two-Spirit, among others are also encouraged.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">NIH operationally defines SGM populations as individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, Two-Spirit, queer, and/or intersex. Individuals with same-sex or -gender attractions or behaviors and those with a difference in sex development are also included. These populations also encompass those who do not self-identify with one of these terms but whose sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or reproductive development is characterized by non-binary constructs of sexual orientation, gender, and/or sex.</p><p style="margin-left:15.85pt;">Finally, low socioeconomic status refers to individuals with low educational achievement (less than high school completion) and/or low household income (up to 200% poverty level).</p><p style="margin-left:15.85pt;"><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p><p style="margin-left:15.7pt;">The main objective of this funding opportunity is to solicit research to address health and healthcare disparities among SGM populations by identifying etiological mechanisms and pathways and developing and evaluating interventions focused on racial and ethnic minoritized populations and those of lower SES. A recent NIMHD workshop on health disparities among SGM groups (<a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/news-events/conferences-events/health-disparities-among-sgm-workshop.html">https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/news-events/conferences-events/health-disparities-among-sgm-workshop.html</a>) highlighted key ideas for furthering research on addressing health and healthcare disparities among SGM populations. Findings emphasized the need for developing and evaluating preventative and treatment-focused interventions on multilevel mechanisms to address SGM health disparities.</p><p style="margin-left:15.7pt;">For intervention-based studies, implementation science is encouraged especially in terms of integrating clinical research to facilitate the timely translation of interventions into practice to promote SGM health (e.g., hybrid trials that combine clinical effectiveness and implementation research). Specifically, when it comes to SGM populations interacting with the healthcare system, a need exists for interventions that promote culturally sensitive and supportive health care (e.g., care that addresses intergenerational trauma) to address barriers to care, including financial and systems-level barriers. Also important are community-led research approaches such as community-based participatory research to ensure the prioritization of SGM community needs and to ensure non-stigmatizing responses to these needs.</p><p style="margin-left:15.7pt;">For observational and etiological studies, research is encouraged on the biological mechanisms linking chronic stress to SGM health outcomes (e.g., the effects of stress on the microbiome). Investigators should use an intersectionality perspective to acknowledge the interlocking major systems contributing to health disparities including structural racism, sexism, heterosexism, transphobia, classism, and ableism, that affect health outcomes in SGM populations with multiple intersecting identities. Longitudinal multi-level research is encouraged to investigate the roles of policies at the federal and state levels, SGM-specific, and school or educational policies on health outcomes. Research must consider the role of individual and structural social determinants of health (SDOH) such as poverty, housing instability, food insecurity, poor access to and quality of care, as potential mechanisms driving SGM health disparities. Studies focusing on examining protective and resiliency factors and promoting well-being are also encouraged.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Of particular interest are projects designed to examine pathways and mechanisms using conceptual model(s) grounded in minority health and health disparities theories that recognize that health disparities arise by multiple and overlapping contributing factors acting at multiple levels and domains of influence (See the NIMHD Research Framework, <a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html">https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html</a>). Of interest are evaluations of interventions or strategies that address SGM health disparities in diverse SGM populations grounded in determinant frameworks (minority stress, intersectionality, life course, syndemics, empowerment, resilience) and that utilize multi-disciplinary interventional approaches.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Intersectional approaches that consider different social identities and the embeddedness of persons within families, households, and communities are encouraged. Projects that utilize a syndemics lens (i.e., multiple disease states interlinked by social, environmental, and structural conditions) to examine SGM disparities in co-occurring health conditions are also encouraged. Studies should consider life course approaches especially in terms of critical transitional periods for SGM populations. In addition, exploring the role of inequality generating mechanisms that are implicated in SGM health disparities such as racism and discrimination, classism, sexism, ageism, and other power structures is also encouraged. Projects are encouraged to examine resiliency and protective factors as well as ways to promote health and well-being.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Additionally, projects that focus on diseases or conditions with some evidence of health or healthcare disparities in SGM populations (e.g., suicide, depression, obesity, tobacco use, substance use, COVID, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, reproductive health, COVID-19, sleep disturbances) as well as comorbidities and general indicators of health such as greater global burden of disease, lower health-related quality of life, and daily functioning are encouraged.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Also encouraged are projects exploring mechanisms implicated in healthcare disparities among SGM populations including but not limited to disparities in access to preventive and primary care, subspecialty care, and urgent and emergency care, in health insurance coverage, and in quality of healthcare. Moreover, of interest are projects that examine access to patient-centered and culturally appropriate care for SGM patients from racial and ethnic minoritized populations.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Projects may involve primary data collection and/or secondary analysis of existing datasets. Projects may utilize observational studies, natural experiments, quasi-experiments, clinical trials, simulation modeling, as well as use of large-scale longitudinal data sets, data mining techniques, registries, surveillance data, and linking to administrative data sets. Quantitative and mixed methods approaches are encouraged.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">Studies involving primary data collection are strongly encouraged to incorporate SDOH measures from the Core and Specialty collections that are available in the Social Determinants of Health Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (<a href="http://www.phenxtoolkit.org/" title="Link to Non-U.S. Government Site">www.phenxtoolkit.org</a>). Moreover, secondary data analyses of datasets with Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) measures or with data linkages are encouraged.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;">As appropriate for the research questions posed, investigators should consider forging research collaborations with community partners in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of the research to generate better-informed hypotheses and enhance the translation of the research results into practice. Applicants must have a history of successful recruitment and retention of participants within the populations of focus and conduct effective communication, co-creation, and dissemination activities to inform communities about the project and its findings. Projects must have clearly defined roles for all partners. As appropriate, study budgets should include funds for community collaborations and partnerships to be fully engaged in research design and implementation. Approaches to engaging community members through the research process, such as team science, community-engaged research, participatory action research, empowerment evaluation approaches, community asset mapping, citizen science, and community health workers are strongly encouraged.</p><p style="margin-left:.25in;"><strong>Design, Analysis, and Sample Size for Studies to Evaluate Group-Based Interventions:</strong> Investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention are strongly encouraged to use appropriate intervention study designs, such as a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, a stepped-wedge group- or cluster randomized trial, a rigorous quasi-experimental design such as a group- or cluster-level regression discontinuity design or an interrupted time-series design, or a rigorous alternative. Also encouraged are pragmatic trials designed in clinical settings to show the real-world effectiveness of the intervention. Intervention designs that lack comparison conditions or sites (e.g., an intervention implemented in a single clinic or neighborhood) are strongly discouraged. Whenever participants are assigned to study arms in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities, counties, states) and observations taken on individual participants are analyzed for intervention effects, special methods are required for analysis and sample size. Methods consistent with plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions should be documented in the application. Additional information is available at: <a href="https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/">https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/</a>. Applications should also delineate outcomes and how the intervention or strategies can be sustained and scaled-up to improve population health.</p><p style="margin-left:15.7pt;"><strong>Areas of

support research that is well aligned with the <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/about/nccih-strategic-plan-2021-2025">NCCIH Strategic Plan</a>. Research areas funded by the institute broadly fall into three therapeutic areas, including nutritional, psychological, and physical approaches. These may include the array of natural products derived from plants, fungi, bacteria, marine organisms, or animals, including pro/prebiotics; as well as mind and body approaches such as yoga, massage therapy, meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction, guided imagery, clinical hypnosis, spinal/joint manipulation, acupuncture, and art- and music-based interventions. Approaches may also be combined (e.g., meditation and yoga, such as in mindfulness-based stress reduction MBSR). NCCIH is interested in research that takes a transdisciplinary approach and integrates natural, social, and health sciences and transcends traditional boundaries to investigate the multifactorial process of whole person health restoration. For the purposes of this NOFO, NCCIH is interested in research on the contributions of disability status and related factors (e.g., emotional well-being, social determinants of health such as access to affordable complementary and integrative health approaches) on the mechanisms of action of interventions that include complementary and integrative therapeutics. Only Basic and Experimental Studies with Humans (BESH) clinical trials will be supported for such mechanistic studies.  NCCIH is also interested in research that investigates the influence of disability status on the utilization and ability of complementary and integrative approaches to improve health outcomes among people from diverse racial, ethnic, socioeconomic populations. For such studies, NCCIH will only support applications in the area of complementary and integrative health that do not propose clinical trials such as analyses of large, nationally representative datasets or registries, or observational studies. NCCIH will not support feasibility and efficacy trials through this NOFO (please see <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/funding-opportunities">NCCIH Clinical Trial Funding Opportunities </a>instead for feasibility and efficacy clinical trials). Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their plans with NCCIH Scientific/Research contact prior to submitting their application to identify the most appropriate NOFO for their research.</p><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>Applications Not Responsive to the NOFO:</strong></p><ul><li>Projects that do not utilize a clear conceptual framework(s) and/or theoretical models.</li></ul>
